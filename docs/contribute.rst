How to Contribute
=================

Follow the steps below to contribute to the project.

Basics git command for implementing a new feature:
 * Cloning the repository:
   ``git clone https://github.com/cta-observatory/cta-lstchain.git``
 * Checking out a branch:
   ``git switch -c mybranch``
 * Download the private test data using ``./download_test_data.sh``,
   ask one of the maintainers if you do not know the credentials.
 * Make the changes in ``<file>``
 * Run the unit tests
 * Committing your changes:
   ``git add <file>``, ``git commit``
 * Submitting changes:
   ``git push -u origin mybranch``

Unit tests
----------
Perform tests locally with ``pytest`` before committing the changed file.

Running just ``pytest`` will not run the tests requiring the private test data,
but as these are important, as these include for example all tests on observed LST data,
run ``pytest -m 'private_data or not private_data'``, to exectute all tests.

Build the documentation locally
-------------------------------
Install the required dependencies for building the documentation: ``pip install -e .[docs]``

Compile the documentation from ``docs``: ``make clean html``.

To look at the documentation in your browser, this command is handy:

.. code::

    python -m http.server -d _build/html

Then visit the printed url.

.. note::
    Automatic documentation deployment is actually doing:
    ``make html SPHINXOPTS="-W --keep-going -n --color -j auto"``
