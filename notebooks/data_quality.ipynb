    "## Data quality selection notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This run selection tool looks for good quality runs for the requested sky region, range of zenith and NSB conditions (NOTE: the default selection cuts are valid for low NSB observations).\n",
    "\n",
    "The default cuts are to some extent, arbitrary - obviously, runs which barely fail to be selected are not totally useless... so, depending on the goal of an analysis it may be wise to relax (or tighten) the selection. For example, cuts could be softer if the goal is just source detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "The default cuts set below are intended to provide a good quality low-NSB sample for flux calculations (energy spectrum, light curve), while keeping systematic errors related to variable performance an atmospheric conditions at an *acceptable* level. The selection is not the same as in the LST1 performance paper (ApJ 956), but it should provide data of about the same quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the selection here is performed at the run level but, as can be clearly seen below, we could benefit of a selection at the level of a subrun, or even based on shorter time periods (the approach that will be followed by CTA). This however is probably something to be introduced at a higher stage of the analysis, likely in the DL2 to DL3 stage\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cosmics intensity spectra\n",
    "The selection is based on the **differential intensity spectra of the detected showers, dR/dI (events / s / p.e.)** , where intensity is the image intensity, total number of p.e. in pixels which survive image cleaning.\n",
    "These spectra are computed on a subrun-wise basis (as part of the DL1 data check). The idea is that at intensities well above the camera threshold, the rate of cosmics, for optimal atmospheric conditions and nominal telescope performance, should depend mainly on the telescope pointing (with perhaps some small yearly modulation due to seasonal atmospheric variations). If, all other things being equal, we modify the amount of recorded light (e.g. because of a lower telescope throughput, or a higher-than-usual atmospheric absorption) we will not record fewer \"high-intensity\" showers (unless the reduction of light is so strong as to go all the way down to the threshold): all those high-intensity showers will still trigger, but will be recorded at a lower intensity. The dR/dI spectrum in that high-intensity region will shift to lower values.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have characterized the high-intensity dR/dI spectra with a power-law fit between 316 and 562 p.e. (these are edges of the intensity histogram binning in the DL1 data check). The fit parameters (normalization and index) have clear zenith-distance dependencies that we have corrected, to get \"ZD=0-equivalent\" values. We then compute, from this ZD-corrected fits, the value of dR/dI in the middle of the fit range (422 p.e.). This value, and the power-law index, are used to judge whether a given run looks \"of good quality\" or not. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since we have these parameters for every subrun, we also use their variability of the quantities through a run as a proxy for data quality. We obtain a Lomb-Scargle periodogram of dR/dI@422 p.e. to spot runs with unstable behaviour. The original idea was to use this to spot periodic increases of rate due to the MAGIC LIDAR. It is not clear if it is the best way to do this. For now, we just compute the maximum amplitude in the LS periodogram (of the dRdI vs. time) of the run as a selection parameter, cutting the tail of the distribution (see below).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Outline of the selection procedure:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The user sets \n",
    "    * the desired Sky Region (e.g. for wobble observations of a given source)\n",
    "    * the range of dates (in YYYYMMDD format)\n",
    "    * the zenith distance range\n",
    "    * the maximum allowed NSB level\n",
    "\n",
    "Then the following additional criteria are used to determine what a good run is:\n",
    "\n",
    "* the run must contain interleaved flatfield and pedestal events (only runs with no interleaved **at all** are rejected)\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "* the pointing (in sky coordinates) must be stable (details can be found below)\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "* the mean P-value of the dR/dI power-law fit (for all subruns in a run) must be above a given threshold (to exclude bad fits). The cut value depends on the number of subruns, see details later in the notebook.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "* the maximum amplitude of the Lomb-Scargle periodogram of dR/dI@422 p.e. through the run must be below a given value (just to exclude very unstable runs). NOTE: some high values may be due to the periodic shots of the MAGIC LIDAR, in that case they might be recoverable, since down the pipeline the LIDAR-induced events are very gamma-unlike and easily identified.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "* the fitted power-law index of dR/dI (mean in run) must be within a given range (see default cut values later in the notebook)\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "* dR/dI@422 p.e. (mean in run) must above a certain value (1.5 events/s/p.e. by default), and 80% of the subrun-wise values must be contained in a range of 0.15 around the most frequent value (mode) in the run.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "* the so-called intensity threshold (value of intensity for which dR/dI reaches half of the peak for cosmics) is below a given value (see below in the notebook). This is a proxy for energy threshold (for a given zenith). The default cut is not tight, because even data with high threshold may be of very good quality, and valid to obtain a spectrum. Only when one is targeting very low energies (e.g. for pulsar analysis) then it may be necessary to make a stricter selection than the default one.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Optimistic note: if we ever have **data in which the event rate is dominated by gammas**, one should be careful with the data selection... the assumption is that the rate of cosmics is **completely dominated by protons** and other nuclei!\n"
