    """

    Parameters
    ----------
    rng: numpy.random.default_rng  random number generator

    image: charges (p.e.) in the camera

    To be tuned by comparing the starting MC and data:

    extra_noise_in_dim_pixels: mean additional number of p.e. to be added (
    Poisson noise) to pixels with charge below transition_charge

    extra_bias_in_dim_pixels: mean bias (w.r.t. original charge) of the new
    charge in pixels. Should be 0 for non-peak-search pulse integrators

    transition_charge: border between "dim" and "bright" pixels

    extra_noise_in_bright_pixels: mean additional number of p.e. to be added (
    Poisson noise) to pixels with charge above transition_charge. This is
    unbiased, i.e. Poisson noise is introduced, and its average subtracted,
    so that the mean charge in bright pixels remains unaltered. This is
    because we assume that above transition_charge the integration window
    is determined by the Cherenkov light, and would not be modified by the
    additional NSB noise (presumably small compared to the C-light)

    Returns
    -------
    Modified (noisier) image

    fraction: fraction of the light in a pixel that will be

    neighboring pixels, according to Poisson statistics. Some light is
    lost for pixels which are at the camera edge and hence don't have all
